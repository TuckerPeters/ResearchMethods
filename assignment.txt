2.2 Stata data set. Compile a data set in Stata format (.dta) that you could use as part of an analysis
for your research project. The data set should contain these elements:
• File name is YourLastNameDraft.dta
• A total of at least 5 variables
• Each variable should include
--variable labels
--value labels for numeric variables that are nominal or ordinal (not including case ID numbers).
• There should be a consistent unit of analysis across all variables, meaning the rows in the data set
should all be the same type of unit. For example, each row should be an individual person if
you’re working with survey data; or a state if you have state-level data; and so on. Don’t
combine different types of units of analysis into a single data set.
• All variables should be properly encoded and formatted so one can obtain meaningful results
when running appropriate Stata analysis commands that we’re learning in class.
2.3 Stata .do file. Include a proper .do file, accompanying your .dta file, with these elements:
• File name is YourLastNameDraft.do
• An abstract at the top that follows the format of the example we discussed in class on 9/23. (Feel
free to include additional items in the abstract if you’d like to provide more detail.)
• Code to attach variable labels to each variable.**
• Code to attach value labels to values for nominal or ordinal variables.**
• Code to run appropriate commands to produce tabular summaries (for nominal and ordinal
variables) or descriptive statistics (for interval and ratio variables).
• Code to produce at least 1 appropriate data visualization from the techniques we’ve learned.
**Note: If your file already contains these because your original source attached them then
simply include a comment note in the .do file saying that.

2.4 Codebook file. This file provides written documentation so readers can understand the contents of
the data set before beginning to analyze the data. Set up the codebook with these sections and elements.
• Save the file as a Word document.
• File name is YourLastNameCodebookDraft.docx.
• Include page numbers.
• Overview section: Include these elements:
--Your name
--Date
--Your GOVT 301 section
--AI disclosure statement: Describe how you used AI, following the guidance in section 2.1, or
attest that you did not use AI to develop the data set or elements of the codebook.
--A brief, clearly written statement (approximately 2-4 sentences) that describes the data set.
There should be enough detail that a person would understand in a broad sense what to expect
when they open the data set to use it.
--Optional: Any additional notes you think would be useful to clarify at the start.
• Data sources section: Provide documentation of the original sources and links to the places
where you found the raw data. Also, if you went to a website and had to do certain steps to
extract the data from the site (i.e., run some sort of query or a set of queries), describe those steps
here. Basically, you want to provide details so a person could retrace all your steps and find the
original data you found.
• Variables section: List the variables one by one and include:
--variable name
--variable label
--basic descriptive statistics (for interval and ratio variables) or tabular summaries (for nominal
and ordinal variables) for each variable. An easy way to do this is to run the Stata command
codebook for all your variables. Then copy the results of that into your document and clean up
the formatting where it might be cluttered
