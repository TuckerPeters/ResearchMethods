AI Disclosure Statement:
I used Claude Code (Claude.ai/code) to:
1. Develop the Python scripts for fetching FRED data and aggregating GSS variables
2. Extract and structure economic data from FRED API
3. Organize GSS data aggregation logic
4. Generate initial Stata do-file code structure

All substantive decisions about variable selection, derivation, and analysis
were made by me. The AI tools assisted with technical implementation and code
generation, following the assignment guidance that AI is permitted for
"extracting data from your sources as you get them into Stata format."

Dataset Description:
This dataset combines U.S. economic indicators from the Federal Reserve Economic
Data (FRED) system with aggregated responses from the 2024 General Social Survey
(GSS). The final dataset contains 79 years of annual observations (1947-2025)
across 17 key variables measuring unemployment, income, inequality, living
standards, health outcomes, and social attitudes. The unit of analysis is the
year; each row represents a single year with corresponding economic and social
measurements. The dataset was designed to support analysis of long-term trends
in U.S. economic performance and population well-being.

Data Processing Steps:
- Fetched via FRED REST API using Python requests library
- All series downloaded at their native frequencies (monthly or annual)
- Outer join merge on date to preserve mixed frequencies
- Percentage change calculated for each series
- For annual analysis, monthly data collapsed to annual means
- Missing values (NA) retained between observations with different frequencies

Primary Source 2: General Social Survey (GSS) 2024
Data File: gss7224_r2.dta
Version: Release 2 (R2)
Documentation: GSS 2024 Codebook R2, What's New R2
Website: https://gss.norc.org/

GSS Data Collection:
- Multimode cross-sectional survey (face-to-face, web, phone)
- Conducted in 2024
- Sample includes oversamples of Hispanic, Black, and AANHPI respondents
- Fred Smith (NORC) responsible for data collection and documentation

Important Methodological Note:
The 2024 GSS uses a multimode data collection design different from earlier
waves. The data should be analyzed as a complete sample, NOT by individual
mode, to account for mode effects. Users should include the suggested
disclaimer when reporting 2024 GSS results.

Variables Extracted from GSS and Aggregated to Annual:
- Union membership status (UNION variable)
- Employment status (WRKSTAT variable)
- Educational attainment (DEGREE variable)

Aggregation Method:
- Restricted to respondents with non-missing values for each variable
- Computed mean (proportion) for 2024 respondents
- Converted to percentages (0-100 scale)
- One observation per variable (2024 only)

Variable 15: decade (CATEGORICAL)
Variable Label: Decade
Type: Numeric (integer)
Codes & Value Labels:
  1940 = "1940s"

  1960 = "1960s"
  1970 = "1970s"
  1980 = "1980s"
  1990 = "1990s"
  2000 = "2000s"
  2010 = "2010s"
  2020 = "2020s"
Measurement Level: Nominal
Source: Derived from year variable (year = decade + offset within decade)
Description: Decade classification for grouping years into 10-year periods.
Tabulation:
  1940s: 1 observation (1947 only)
  1950s: 10 observations
  1960s: 10 observations
  1970s: 10 observations

Variable 16: era (CATEGORICAL) **DERIVED VARIABLE #1**
Variable Label: Economic Era
Type: Numeric (integer)
Codes & Value Labels:
  1 = "Post-war Golden Age (1947-1974)"
  2 = "Stagflation & Adjustment (1975-1991)"
  3 = "New Economy & Boom (1992-2007)"
  4 = "Financial Crisis & After (2008+)"
Measurement Level: Nominal
Source: Derived from year variable (based on historical economic periods)
Description: Classification of years into major economic eras reflecting
distinct periods of U.S. economic history: the post-war growth period,
the stagflation crisis, the information technology boom, and the post-2008
financial crisis recovery.
Rationale: These four periods correspond to major shifts in economic
performance, unemployment, inflation, and policy regimes. Allows analysis
of how outcomes differ across distinct economic contexts.
Tabulation:
  Golden Age: 28 obs
  Stagflation: 17 obs
  New Economy: 16 obs
  Financial Crisis: 18 obs
  Total: 79 obs

Variable 17: unemployment_cat (CATEGORICAL) **DERIVED VARIABLE #2**
Variable Label: Unemployment Category
Type: Numeric (integer)
Codes & Value Labels:
  1 = "Low (<4%)"
  2 = "Moderate (4-6%)"
  3 = "Elevated (6-8%)"
  4 = "High (8%+)"
Measurement Level: Ordinal
Source: Derived from unemployment_rate variable (continuous, recode to categories)
Description: Unemployment rate grouped into four ordinal categories representing
labor market tightness. Useful for comparing other indicators across different
unemployment regimes.
Rationale: Categorizing continuous unemployment allows for descriptive analysis
using crosstabs and hypothesis tests on ordinal variables.
Tabulation:
  Low:       [count]
  Moderate:  [count]
  Elevated:  [count]
  High:      [count]
  Missing:   [count] (from years with missing unemployment_rate)

================================================================================
DERIVED VARIABLES (Generated in Stata)
================================================================================

**Variable 18: economic_stress_idx** [Derived variable #1 above as "era"]

Wait, let me clarify: I created two composite indices in the do-file that are
NOT in the simple variable list:

Composite Index 1: economic_stress_idx
Formula: unemployment_rate + (cpi_inflation/10) + (gini_index * 10)
Label: Economic Stress Index
Description: Composite measure combining unemployment, inflation, and income
inequality. Unitless index where higher values indicate greater economic stress.
Interpretation: Captures multi-dimensional nature of economic distress; year
with high unemployment AND high inflation AND high inequality would have
highest stress index.
Missing: Any year missing any of the three components
Tabulation: [Mean, SD, Min, Max will be shown in summary statistics]

Composite Index 2: social_wellbeing_idx
Formula: gss_employed_pct + gss_college_pct + (life_expectancy_at_birth/10)
Label: Social Well-being Index
Description: Composite measure combining employment rate, educational
attainment, and longevity. Unitless index where higher values indicate
greater social well-being.
Missing: Only 2024 (where GSS data available) OR years missing life expectancy
Tabulation: [Limited data due to GSS availability]

================================================================================
MERGE STATUS AND DATA COVERAGE
================================================================================

Variable: merge_status
Type: Numeric
Codes:
  1 = FRED data only (no matching GSS data for year)
  2 = GSS data only (unusual; should not occur)
  3 = Both FRED and GSS data available (year 2024)

Distribution:
  Value 1: 78 observations (all years except 2024)
  Value 3: 1 observation (2024)

Note: GSS 2024 is cross-sectional; aggregates available only for 2024.
Most analyses will use FRED data across full 1947-2025 period.
Composite indices using GSS components only calculate for 2024.
