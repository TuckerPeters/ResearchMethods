# Quick Start Guide
## Peters GOVT 301 Final Project

### In 3 Steps:

#### Step 1: Generate FRED Data
```bash
python3 fred.py
```
**Creates:** `population_impact_datasets.csv`

#### Step 2: Run Stata Analysis
```stata
do PetersFinal_StudentStyle.do
```
**Creates:** `PetersFinal.dta` + 6 graphs + statistics output

#### Step 3: Create Documents
Convert the templates to Word (.docx):
- `PetersCodebookFinal_template.txt` → `PetersCodebookFinal.docx`
- `PetersAnalysis_template.txt` → `PetersAnalysis.docx`

Fill in with your data/analysis, then email all 4 files to Prof. Manna.

## Files You'll Submit

1. **PetersFinal.dta** - Generated by Stata
2. **PetersFinal.do** - The Stata script
3. **PetersCodebookFinal.docx** - Data documentation
4. **PetersAnalysis.docx** - Results & interpretation

---

## What the Code Does

### Python (`fred.py`)
- Fetches 17 economic series from FRED API
- Merges them at native frequencies
- Saves as CSV

### Stata (`PetersFinal_StudentStyle.do`)
- Loads CSV and collapses to annual
- Loads GSS and aggregates by year
- Merges both datasets
- Creates 4 new variables
- Adds labels
- Makes 6 graphs
- Calculates summary statistics
- Saves final dataset

---

## Key Variables Created

**From FRED:**
- Unemployment rate
- Labor force participation
- Median household income
- Gini index (inequality)
- Life expectancy
- CPI inflation
- Minimum wage
- Rent
- Population

**You Create:**
- `econ_stress` - Composite index (unemployment + inflation + inequality)
- `unemp_category` - Groups unemployment into Low/Moderate/Elevated/High
- `decade` - Which decade each year belongs to
- Plus: era classification (Golden Age / Stagflation / New Economy / Crisis)

---

## Common Issues & Fixes

**"CSV file not found"**
- Run `python3 fred.py` first
- Check you're in the right directory

**"GSS file not found"**
- Should be `gss7224_r2.dta` in your working directory
- If not, do-file will still work but GSS variables will be missing

**Graph exports fail**
- Make sure you have write permissions in your working directory
- Check the working directory is correct: `pwd` in terminal

**Memory error**
- In Stata: `set memory 2g` before running do-file

---

## For Showing Students

The file **`PetersFinal_StudentStyle.do`** is written to be a good example of:
- Clear commenting
- Step-by-step processing
- Checking work with displays
- Simple, understandable syntax
- Proper labeling practices
- Good graph conventions

Show them:
1. How tempfiles work for safety
2. How to collapse data
3. How to merge datasets
4. How to create categories with generate/recode
5. How to label variables and values
6. Basic graph creation

---

## Expected Output

After running the do-file, you should have:

**In your working directory:**
- `PetersFinal.dta` (79 observations × 17 variables)
- `unemployment.png`
- `life_expectancy.png`
- `gini_index.png`
- `unemployment_by_decade.png`
- `economic_stress.png`
- `income_vs_lifeexp.png`

**In Stata console:**
- Descriptive statistics
- Tabulation of unemployment by decade
- Value counts from merge

---

## Timeline to Submission (Nov 21, 5pm)

**Day 1:** Run `python3 fred.py`
**Day 2:** Run `PetersFinal_StudentStyle.do` in Stata
**Day 3:** Create Word documents from templates
**Day 4:** Fill in stats and graphs, write analysis
**Day 5:** Submit to Prof. Manna
