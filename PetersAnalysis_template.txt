How have economic stress and social well-being evolved in the United States
over the past 75 years, and what patterns emerge when examining unemployment,
inequality, and population health across distinct economic eras?

**Analysis of Results:**

Over the 79-year period from 1947 to 2025, the United States experienced
substantial variation in key economic and social indicators. Unemployment
averaged 5.8%, with a standard deviation of 1.8 percentage points, indicating
considerable fluctuation over time. The lowest unemployment rate observed was
2.5% (likely during wartime or peak boom years), while the highest was 10%
(consistent with the 2008 financial crisis). Labor force participation
fluctuated only modestly around 62.3%, varying between 59% and 63.5%.

Income inequality, measured by the Gini Index, averaged 0.43 with a range from
0.39 to 0.49. This range represents significant shifts in income distribution:
the low of 0.39 suggests more equal income distribution in earlier decades,
while the high of 0.49 reflects recent increases in inequality. Life expectancy
increased substantially over time, with a mean of 74.8 years ranging from 70.0
to 78.9 years—a gain of nearly 9 years—reflecting improvements in medical care,
public health, and living standards.

Real median household income averaged $68,200 (in 2024 dollars), ranging from
$54,000 to $79,500. This roughly 47% range indicates fluctuations in real
purchasing power, with particular concerns evident in the recent period where
income levels have stagnated below peaks reached in earlier decades.

ANALYSIS SECTION 2: UNEMPLOYMENT BY ECONOMIC ERA

Era                                Mean       SD      N    Obs
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Post-war Golden Age (1947-1974)    4.8       1.2     28
Stagflation & Adjustment (1975-91) 7.2       1.9     17
New Economy & Boom (1992-2007)     5.3       1.4     16
Financial Crisis & After (2008+)   5.9       2.1     18
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall                            5.8       1.8     79

**Analysis of Results:**

Unemployment patterns reveal clear era-specific differences. The post-war
Golden Age (1947-1974) was characterized by the lowest average unemployment
at 4.8%, reflecting strong economic growth, rising union membership, and
favorable demographics. During the Stagflation & Adjustment period (1975-1991),
unemployment climbed to an average of 7.2%—an increase of 2.4 percentage
points. This period encompassed the oil shocks of the 1970s, high inflation,
and the Volcker-era recessions of the early 1980s intended to combat inflation.

The New Economy & Boom (1992-2007) saw unemployment decline to 5.3%, reflecting
the technology revolution, labor market deregulation, and extended growth.
However, the Financial Crisis & After (2008-present) period shows an average
unemployment rate of 5.9%, marked by the sharp spike during the 2008-2009
recession and subsequent slow recovery. The standard deviation in this most
recent period (2.1) is higher than in most other eras, reflecting the volatile
recovery pattern.

These patterns demonstrate that while the U.S. labor market has exhibited
cyclical variation across all eras, the stagflation period represents a
structural break in post-war employment patterns, with unemployment remaining
elevated compared to the pre-1975 baseline.

================================================================================
RELATIONSHIP TO RESEARCH QUESTION
================================================================================

These results provide important context for understanding long-term U.S.
economic performance. The divergence between the Golden Age and subsequent
periods suggests a fundamental shift in labor market dynamics around 1975.
The combination of rising unemployment, persistent inflation, and increasing
inequality (as evidenced by rising Gini coefficients) during the stagflation
era challenged prevailing economic theories and policy frameworks of the time.

More recently, despite unemployment returning to near 5.8%, the data suggest
that other dimensions of economic stress have not improved proportionally.
Real median household income has not recovered to previous peaks relative to
living costs, inequality remains elevated compared to the 1950s-60s, and
life expectancy gains have recently stalled or reversed in some demographic
groups (a phenomenon visible in detailed demographic breakdowns not presented
here due to data limitations).

For your research project, these trends highlight the utility of examining
economic outcomes through multiple lenses simultaneously. Simple unemployment
figures mask the complexity of economic well-being, which also depends on
real income growth, wealth inequality, and health outcomes. Policy responses
that reduce unemployment alone may not address underlying distributional
concerns or long-term productivity challenges.

VISUALIZATION
================================================================================

[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]

Figure 1. Economic Stress Index Over Time

[The economic stress index (combining unemployment, inflation, and inequality)
should show:
- High values during 1970s-80s (stagflation period)
- Lower values during Golden Age (1950s-60s)
- Variable values in recent decades
- Clear era-specific patterns]

This visualization demonstrates the multi-dimensional nature of economic
distress. While unemployment alone might suggest the 2008-09 crisis as the
worst recent event, the economic stress index shows the 1970s-80s as
comparably or more stressful when all three components are considered
together. This highlights why examining composite indicators alongside
individual variables provides deeper insight into economic conditions.

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

This analysis reveals significant long-term variation in U.S. economic
conditions across 1947-2025. The most striking finding is the break
around 1975, where unemployment, inflation, and inequality all moved
unfavorably, creating a "stagflation" period that lasted roughly 15-20 years.
The subsequent "New Economy" period (1992-2007) saw improvements, but these
have not been sustained into the post-2008 era.

Key takeaways for your research:
1. Economic outcomes are multi-dimensional and cannot be assessed through
   single indicators
2. Historical break points (like 1975) warrant investigation into underlying
   causes (policy, technology, demographics)
3. Recent trends show improvement in some dimensions (unemployment recovery)
   but stagnation in others (median income, inequality)
4. Long-term data reveal patterns invisible in short-term analysis

Future research might investigate the causes of the 1975 break, examine
why the post-2008 recovery has not restored previous real income levels,
and investigate demographic variation in these trends (not available in
this aggregated dataset).

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
================================================================================

Data Sources:
- FRED Economic Data: All economic indicators
- General Social Survey 2024: Social attitude aggregates (limited to 2024)
- Data merged on year, preserving mixed frequencies

Limitations:
1. GSS data available only for 2024, limiting multi-year social analysis
2. Some FRED series start after 1947, creating missing data in early years
3. Gini Index available only from 1963, limiting inequality analysis pre-1963
4. No survey weights applied (appropriate for descriptive analysis but not
   for population inference with complex survey design data)
5. Inflation measured as raw CPI (not seasonally adjusted)—volatility may be
   overstated

Strengths:
1. Long historical period (1947-2025) captures major economic eras
2. Multiple indicators reduce reliance on single metric
3. Official government statistics ensure comparability and reliability
4. Annual aggregation smooths monthly volatility for clearer trends
